# SatoGreen
###### Helping consumers make Earth-saving changes.

## What we're about?

SatoGreen is a portmanteau of the words Satoyama and Green. Satoyama is a Japanese term to describe the borderland between human habitation and nature, and Green, referring to the green movement. The goal of our project is two-fold:

1. Helping consumers change their spending habits based on how organizations are responsible members of the planet 
2. Assiting all organizations understand how they can improve their specific green scores and the costs, benefits, and steps needed to achieve those goals.

Our objective isn't to punish or force companies to switch to green initiatives without consideration of their bottom lines, but to take a more pragmatic approach. We want to ensure that consumers are well informed, and incentivize organizations to become better world citizens.
